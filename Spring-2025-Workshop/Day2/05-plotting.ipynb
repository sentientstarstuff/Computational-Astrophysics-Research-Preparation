Use the `fontsize` parameter in `xlabel`, `ylabel`, `title`, and `legend`, and [`tick_params` with `labelsize`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.tick_params.html) to increase the text size of the numbers on your axes.\n","- Similarly, you should make your graph elements easy to see. Use `s` to increase the size of your scatterplot markers and `linewidth` to increase the sizes of your plot lines.\n","- Using color (and nothing else) to distinguish between different plot elements will make your plots unreadable to anyone who is colorblind, or who happens to have a black-and-white office printer. For lines, the `linestyle` parameter lets you use different types of lines. For scatterplots, `marker` lets you change the shape of your points. If you're unsure about your colors, you can use [Coblis](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) or [Color Oracle](https://colororacle.org/) to simulate what your plots would look like to those with colorblindness."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c3xyuFI9k7XT","metadata":{"id":"c3xyuFI9k7XT"},"source":["# <p style=\"background-color: #f5df18; padding: 10px;\"> 🗝️ Key points</p>\n","---\n","\n","- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) is the most widely used scientific plotting library in Python.\n","- Plot data directly from a Pandas dataframe.\n","- Select and transform data, then plot it.\n","- Many styles of plot are available: see the [Python Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com/matplotlib/) for more options.\n","- Can plot many sets of data together."]}],"metadata":{"celltoolbar":"Slideshow","colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.9"},"toc-showcode":true},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
