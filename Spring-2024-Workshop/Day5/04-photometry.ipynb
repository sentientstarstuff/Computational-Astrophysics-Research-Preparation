The color magnitude diagram is a technique developed to separate these features out just as pathologists have techniques to contrast human tissue.\n",

Dust will remove light from the star's path to our telescopes, which makes the star seem like it has less energy than it otherwise would have, which makes it do two things on this diagram: 1) look fainter (lower on the y-axis; larger magnitude value) and 2) look cooler (higher x-axis value). The stars spread throughout the diagram are all stars bright enough to be detected in our Milky Way between GD-1 and us but made fainter and redder (spread to the lower-right) by their spread in distance from us and the amount dust in the line of sight.\n"
